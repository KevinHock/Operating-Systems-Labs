Unsolved test cases:
1.Infinite Loop 	./stdlib -c - -		Read hangs and sleep might be part of stdlib, low priority on my list either way.

The line
ofileSize = ostbuf.st_size;
causes things on the stack to be overwritten only when compiled with -nostdlib (no I wasn't even including stdlib or stdio) which is why this is late. If you don't believe me there is an array at line 123 the size of a dword that gets overwritten perfectly like a good exploit.

I wrote it in libc first and it worked perfectly. Then everything was going great until I tried calling mmap through this format "buffer = mmap(0, fileSize, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, g, 0);" and it destroyed me and my entire project.
