If you look at my algorithms and logic it's all solid, design flaws did me in.
It goes through checks all the flags and determines the code flow from there.
I wrote it in libc first and it worked perfectly. Then everything was going great until I tried calling mmap through this format "buffer = mmap(0, fileSize, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, g, 0);" and it destroyed me and my entire project. I was unware of the fact that I could just use [1000] until it was all too late; have mercy.
