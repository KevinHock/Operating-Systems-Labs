Answer for question 1:
	It is comparing the syscall#  to see whether or not the syscall is invalid.This is because right after it jumps to the syscall as indicated by call *sys_call_table(,%eax,4)
Answer for question 2:
	What are in the registers depends on the syscall except eax dictates which syscall it is. As far as rsp is concerned though the stacklayout looks like this. 
         0(%esp) - %ebx
         4(%esp) - %ecx
         8(%esp) - %edx
         C(%esp) - %esi
        10(%esp) - %edi
        14(%esp) - %ebp
