This lab was a simulation of how DNS works using a reverse trie. Me and my lab partner did not make the trie.

Implemented a thread-safe trie in mutex-trie.c, using coarse-grained locking.

Implemented a trie which allows concurrent readers, but mutually excludes writers in rw-trie.c, using coarse-grained locking.

Added squatting support to each of the tries you have implemented so far. 

Attempted to implement a trie that uses fine-grained locking in fine-trie.c.
