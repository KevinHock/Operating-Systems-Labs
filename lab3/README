I made an awesome ATOMIC PRINT macro to print the Thread # the Line # and whatever I wanted to print atomically

IMPORTANT vvvvvvvvv
To confirm that my program is in fact hanging because all threads are waiting you can do the following:

cse306@vl109:~/CSE306/Group/lab3/latest$ ./dns-rw -q -l 100 -c 4 > garymcgraw.txt
cse306@vl109:~/CSE306/Group/lab3/latest$ ^C
cse306@vl109:~/CSE306/Group/lab3/latest$ cat garymcgraw.txt | grep "waiting"
Thread #2 Line #341 1-th time waiting	String is cyrzj
Thread #4 Line #341 2-th time waiting	String is zzpdzfroz
Thread #3 Line #341 3-th time waiting	String is a
Thread #1 Line #341 4-th time waiting	String is z
