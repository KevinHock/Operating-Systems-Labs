I made an awesome ATOMIC PRINT macro to print the Thread # the Line # and whatever I wanted to print atomically

You can comment that out if you need to it's at the beginning of rw-trie and mutex-trie.

ATOMIC PRINT MIGHT NOT WORK FOR OVER 20 THREADS THOUGH THE PROGRAM STILL WORKS

IMPORTANT vvvvvvvvv
To confirm that my program is in fact hanging because all threads are waiting you can do the following:

cse306@vl109:~/CSE306/Group/lab3/latest$ ./dns-rw -q -l 100 -c 4 > garymcgraw.txt
cse306@vl109:~/CSE306/Group/lab3/latest$ ^C
cse306@vl109:~/CSE306/Group/lab3/latest$ cat garymcgraw.txt | grep "waiting"
Thread #2 Line #341 1-th time waiting	String is cyrzj
Thread #4 Line #341 2-th time waiting	String is zzpdzfroz
Thread #3 Line #341 3-th time waiting	String is a
Thread #1 Line #341 4-th time waiting	String is z

IMPORTANT ^^^^^^^^^
