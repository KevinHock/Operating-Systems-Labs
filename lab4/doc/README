Describe how you implemented the main programming assignment. The README
file should describe what you did, what approach you took, results of any
measurements you made, which files are included in your submission and what
they are for, etc.  Feel free to include any other information you think is
helpful to us in this README; it can only help your grade.


sshd port hiding:
	started with the proc_dir_entry and iterated through the folders
	untill I found a folder called tcp or tcp6.
	then I rewrote tcp6_seq_show and tcp4_seq_show
	functions.

hiding directory/files:
	Obtained the address of the syscall table. Set it read/write using the offsets from a linux header file
	we stored the pointer to the original function and replaced it with a custom functions. The syscall table was then set back to 		read only. The functions hooked for this task were getdents and getdents64. We called the original getdents/getdents64 and 		then modified the return results before exiting the function. When a module is unloaded the syscall table is set to read/write 		and the orignal functions are set back in the syscall table. The table is then marked read only again and this part is done.

hiding rootkit from lsmod:
	i created a proc file called apt1 to get a pointer and from there just traversed pionters until i got 
	proc/modules then edited out the line with the rootkit in it in the .read fuction. overall it was 
	pretty easy once i knew the structs well.

hiding sshd from ps:
	Copied everything from hiding directory/file and added if statement to check for the processid that was passed into the program
	from the shellscript.
